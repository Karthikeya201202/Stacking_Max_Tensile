## Ensemble Machine Learning (Stacked ML)
Because merely one ML model could not provide the best solution, various ML models are integrated to select the suitable ML model well-suited to the input data.

An evolutionary algorithm TPOT was chosen to be used in this study which applies genetic algorithms programming in order to optimize the ML pipelines. A different number of
seeds were utilized in the TPOT code in order to ensure that the accuracy of the developed model was not affected by the selection of the training dataset.
